## Charting Options Using Excel's Ribbon
In Excel, there are many charting options available on the Ribbon as well. We could spend all day going through them all, so I'll just touch on the ones I think will be the most useful to you. When you get some free time, be sure to experiment with the others. If you run into trouble or want further explanation on a certain topic, just leave me a post in the Discussion Area. I'll be happy to help you!

With your line chart selected, click the **Design** tab. Notice the labels underneath each grouping of icons: Chart Layouts, Chart Styles, Data, Type, and Location.


**Chart Layouts** : Here you can add or modify any chart element that pertains to your chart type by selecting the Add Chart Element option. Or select the Quick Layout option to apply a predefined chart layout that includes or suppresses various combinations of chart elements.

**Chart Styles**: Here you can modify the color and style of your chart. Click the bottom down arrow at the right side of the Chart Styles section to see all available style options for line charts. There are 16 different chart styles to pick from. The current style is highlighted with a green frame.

**Chart Types**: Luckily, the developers at Microsoft realized that no matter how smart Excel users are, they're bound to change their minds! Now you don't have to go through all the steps again to create a new chart, saving you tons of time. Microsoft Excel will quickly and easily do the hard work for you. Let's say you included this line chart in a report you sent to the boss. Although everyone agrees that sales appear to be dropping, they just don't like line charts, so your boss has requested a different chart type to tell the story. No reason to worry. It's simple to change a chart to a new type.
